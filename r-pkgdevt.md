## Overview

> This article aims to provide an exhaustive list of helpful tools, packages, and resources for developers, authors, maintainers, reviewers, and stakeholders in the R Package development workflow.

Welcome to the world of R Package Development! Whether you're a seasoned R programmer looking to expand your toolkit or a newcomer eager to dive into the exciting realm of package development, you've come to the right place. In this comprehensive guide, we'll unveil the essential resources every R package developer needs to master their craft. From tutorials and books to online communities and tools, we've curated a treasure trove of resources to help you embark on your journey towards becoming a proficient R package developer.

Throughout this article, I will provide a walkthrough of the various packages, tools, resources, and axioms I have encountered over my years as an R package software engineer.

## R User vs. R Developer

In the world of R programming, there are distinct roles and distinctions between an *R User* and an *R Developer*, each with its own set of responsibilities, skills, and objectives.

To distinguish, R developers *develop* new innovative solutions while R Users *use* the tools and packages that the developers created. This article is aimed towards the development side of the spectrum and attempts to provide a comprehensive, curated toolbox for the R Developer, specifically in regard to developing R Packages.

In summary, while both R users and R developers utilize R for data analysis and statistical computing, they differ in their focus and expertise. R users primarily leverage R for data analysis tasks, while R developers specialize in creating and maintaining R packages to enhance the functionality and capabilities of the R programming language for a broader audience of users.

### R Users

- **Definition:** An R user is someone who primarily utilizes R for data analysis, statistical modeling, visualization, and other tasks related to data science, research, or analytics.

- **Skills & Responsibilities:**
  - Proficient in using R for data manipulation, exploration, and analysis.
  - Familiarity with statistical methods and techniques for interpreting data.
  - Ability to create visualizations and plots to communicate insights effectively.
  - Understanding of data structures, functions, and packages within R.
  - May use R for tasks such as data cleaning, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and machine learning

- **Objectives:**
  - Analyze and interpret data to derive meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.
  - Communicate findings through reports, presentations, or visualizations.
  - Utilize R packages and libraries to streamline analysis workflows and enhance productivity.
  - Collaborate with colleagues or stakeholders to address specific analytical needs or research questions.

### R Developer

- **Definition:** An R developer is someone who focuses on creating, maintaining, and extending R packages, libraries, and tools for the broader R community.

- **Skills and Responsibilities:**
  - Proficiency in programming with R, including knowledge of object-oriented programming principles, functions, and package development.
  - Understanding of software engineering practices such as version control, testing, and documentation.
  - Ability to design, implement, and maintain R packages to address specific needs or solve particular problems.
  - Familiarity with R package development tools such as `devtools`, `roxygen2`, and `testthat`.
  - Contribution to the R ecosystem through the creation of new packages, improvement of existing packages, or participation in community discussions and collaborations.

- **Objectives:**
  - Develop and release high-quality R packages that provide valuable functionality to users across different domains.
  - Ensure the reliability, efficiency, and usability of R packages through rigorous testing, documentation, and code review.
  - Engage with the R community to gather feedback, address issues, and collaborate on package development efforts.
  - Stay updated on emerging trends, best practices, and advancements in R programming and package development.

## Getting Started

Now that you understand the difference between an *R User ans R Developer*, a question arises: "How can one go from being a user to a developer?".

The answer is simple, create something! In this case, create an R Package.

Once you have accumulates more than 2-3 common functions that operate within the same context, that is a primary indicator that you should structure your project as an R Package.

After you have more than one function it starts to get easy to lose track of what your functions do. Similarly, it can start to become difficult to track down, name, and organize the functions and you may be tempted to put all of the functions in one file and just source it. Instead, I propose the best solution is to create an R package.

### What you Need

To begin creating an R Package, you need:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed on your machine
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com)
- Some initial R functions
- R Development Packages:
  - `devtools`
  - `usethis`
  - `roxygen2`
  - `pak`
  - `knitr` and `rmarkdown`

From there you can continue to naming your package, scaffolding out its structure, adding functions, documentation, metadata, data, license, vignettes, etc.

## Pre-Requisite Resources

To start, R package developers need to be familiar with the fundamentals of package development, and therefore should be familiar with some of the highest regarded resources available to read.

Anyone who is serious about developing production grade R packages needs to be familiar with most of, if not all of the following resources and guides:
