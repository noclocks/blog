<div data-node-type="callout-text">In the realm of software development, agility, consistency, and quality are more crucial than ever. As projects grow in complexity and teams scale, adhering to foundational best practices becomes essential. This article focuses on two critical paradigms: <strong>Schema-Driven Development (SDD)</strong> and the concept of a <strong>Single Source of Truth (SSOT)</strong>. We'll explore how to derive CRUD APIs directly from SQL DDL database schemas, generate database documentation via DBML, and produce OpenAPI and JSON schemasâ€”all contributing to a more efficient and error-free development process.</div>

## What is Schema-Driven Development?

**Schema-Driven Development** is an approach where a single schema definition serves as the foundational blueprint for all aspects of an application. Instead of manually coding each component, the schema drives the generation of APIs, validations, documentation, and even test cases. This ensures consistency, reduces redundant effort, and minimizes the chances of errors.

### **Key Benefits of SDD**

* **Unified Source of Truth**: All teams and services refer to the same definitions, ensuring alignment.
    
* **Automated Generation**: Reduces manual coding by auto-generating CRUD APIs, documentation, and client libraries.
    
* **Enhanced Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend teams can work simultaneously, reducing bottlenecks.
    
* **Error Reduction**: Automated validations prevent incorrect data from propagating through the system.
    

### **Signs Your Team Isn't Using SDD**

* Multiple, inconsistent schema definitions across services.
    
* Manually crafted APIs, documentation, and test cases.
    
* Sharing Postman collections via email rather than generating them automatically.
    
* Increased bugs due to inconsistent data handling.

## Understanding Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

A **Single Source of Truth** is the practice of structuring information models and associated schemata such that every data element is stored exactly once. In software development, this means all componentsâ€”APIs, databases, servicesâ€”derive their structure from a single schema, typically the database schema.

### **Advantages of SSOT**

* **Data Consistency**: Eliminates discrepancies caused by redundant data definitions.
    
* **Simplified Maintenance**: Updates to the schema automatically reflect across all dependent components.
    
* **Improved Collaboration**: Teams work from a shared understanding, reducing miscommunication.
    
* **Reduced Technical Debt**: Consistent schemas prevent the accumulation of outdated or redundant code.

## Practical Examples: Deriving from SQL DDL

### **Example 1: Generating CRUD APIs from SQL DDL**

**Scenario:** You have an existing database schema defined using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL):

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  published_date DATE,
  isbn VARCHAR(13)
);
```

**Using SDD, you can:**

1. **Generate JSON Schemas:**
    
    Use tools like [`sql-ddl-to-json-schema`](https://github.com/duartealexf/sql-ddl-to-json-schema) to convert your SQL DDL into JSON Schema definitions:
    
    ```json
    {
      "title": "books",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "integer" },
        "title": { "type": "string" },
        "author": { "type": "string" },
        "published_date": { "type": "string", "format": "date" },
        "isbn": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["title", "author"]
    }
    ```
    
2. **Generate OpenAPI Schemas:**
    
    Use the JSON Schemas to create OpenAPI definitions for your RESTful APIs.
    
    ```yaml
    openapi: 3.1.0
    info:
      title: Book API
      version: 1.0.0
    paths:
      /books:
        get:
          summary: List all books
          responses:
            '200':
              description: A list of books.
              content:
                application/json:
                  schema:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      $ref: '#/components/schemas/Book'
    components:
      schemas:
        Book:
          $ref: 'book.schema.json'  # Reference to the generated JSON Schema
    ```
    
3. **Auto-Generate CRUD APIs:**
    
    Use frameworks like **LoopBack 4** or **PostgREST** that can generate RESTful APIs directly from your database schema.
    
    **Using PostgREST:**
    
    * **Setup:** Point PostgREST to your PostgreSQL database.
        
    * **Result:** Instantly get a fully functional REST API adhering to the OpenAPI spec.
        
4. **Generate Database Documentation via DBML:**
    
    Convert your SQL DDL into Database Markup Language (DBML) to create interactive database diagrams and documentation.
    
    **Example DBML:**
    
    ```plaintext
    Table books {
      id int [pk, increment]
      title varchar
      author varchar
      published_date date
      isbn varchar
    }
    ```
    
    **Tools:**
    
    * [**dbdiagram.io**](http://dbdiagram.io): Paste your DBML to visualize and generate documentation.
        
    * [**dbdocs.io**](http://dbdocs.io): Generate and host database documentation online.
        

**Benefit:** Automates the creation of APIs and documentation, ensuring consistency and saving significant development time.

### **Example 2: Validating Data with JSON Schemas**

**Scenario:** Before inserting or updating records in your database, you want to ensure the data conforms to your schema.

1. **Use JSON Schema Validators:**
    
    In your API endpoints, validate incoming JSON payloads against the JSON Schema generated from your SQL DDL.
    
    ```javascript
    const Ajv = require('ajv');
    const ajv = new Ajv();
    const validate = ajv.compile(bookJsonSchema);
    
    app.post('/books', (req, res) => {
      const valid = validate(req.body);
      if (!valid) {
        return res.status(400).json({ errors: validate.errors });
      }
      // Proceed to insert data into the database
    });
    ```
    

**Benefit:** Prevents invalid data from entering your system, reducing runtime errors and ensuring data integrity.

---

### **Example 3: Generating API Documentation**

**Scenario:** You want to provide up-to-date API documentation for your team and third-party developers.

1. **Generate OpenAPI Documentation:**
    
    * Use the OpenAPI schema generated from your database schema.
        
    * Utilize tools like **Swagger UI** or **Redoc** to render interactive documentation.
        
2. **Automate Updates:**
    
    * Integrate the schema generation into your build pipeline.
        
    * Whenever the database schema changes, the OpenAPI docs update automatically.
        

**Benefit:** Ensures that your API documentation is always current and reflects the true state of your APIs.
